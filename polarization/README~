pair_style lj/cut/coul/long/polarization command

Syntax:

pair_style lj/cut/coul/long/polarization cutoff1 (cutoff2) keyword value ...

  cutoff = global cutoff for LJ (and Coulombic if only 1 arg) (distance units)
  cutoff2 = global cutoff for Coulombic (optional) (distance units)

  zero or more keyword/value pairs may be appended

  keyword = precision or zodid or fixed_iteration or damp or max_iterations or damp_type or polar_gs or polar_gs_ranked or polar_gamma

    precision values = precision
      precision = if fixed_iteration is disabled, keep iterating until the square of the change in all dipoles is less than precision
    zodid values = yes or no
      yes/no = whether to only use the first approximation for the induced dipoles
    fixed_iteration values = yes or no
      yes/no = whether to use fixed iteration or precision
    damp values = damp
      damp = the damping parameter if using exponential dipole-dipole interaction damping
    max_iterations values = iterations
      iterations = if using precision, the maximum number of iterations to be calculated before returning the first approximation, or, if using using fixed_iteration, the number of iterations to be calculated
    damp_type values = exponential or none
      exponential = use exponential dipole-dipole interaction damping
      none = don't use any dipole-dipole interaction damping
    polar_gs values = yes or no
      yes/no = whether to use the Gauss-Seidel method to speed up convergence
    polar_gs_ranked values = yes or no
      yes/no = whether to use the Gauss-Seidel method with a ranked array to speed up convergence
    polar_gamma values = gamma
      gamma = number to precondition the dipoles with to speed up convergence

Examples:

pair_style lj/cut/coul/long/polarization 2.5 6 max_iterations 30 damp_type exponential polar_gs_ranked yes

Description:

  IMPORTANT: This pair style does not work with multiple processors.

  The pair style included in this repository adds explicit polarization using induced dipole interactions to the lj/cut/coul/long pair style.

  The electric field created by static charges on other molecules as well as the induced electric field of every other dipole induces dipoles on every atom proportional to their static polarizabilty. The induced dipoles then interact with both the static charges and the other induced dipoles. Polarizabilities are set using the set command and have units of distance^3, for example,

set type 1 static_polarizability 2.19630

  The static electric field is calculated using a shifted-force coulombic equation (similar to wolf with no damping).

  For more information and implementation details about induced dipole interactions see section 8 of the included pdf file "Theory and simulation of metal-organic materials and biomolecules".

Defaults:

  iterations_max = 50
  damping_type = none
  polar_damp = 2.1304
  zodid = no
  polar_precision = 0.0000001
  fixed_iteration = no
  polar_gs = no
  polar_gs_ranked = no
  polar_gamma = 1.0
