The pair style included in this repository adds explicit polarization using induced dipole interactions to the lj/cut/coul/long pair style. For information and implementation details about induced dipole interactions see section 8 of the included pdf file "Theory and simulation of metal-organic materials and biomolecules".

Polarizabilities are set using the set command and have units of length^3, for example,

set type 1 static_polarizability 2.19630

and the pair style is set the normal way.
