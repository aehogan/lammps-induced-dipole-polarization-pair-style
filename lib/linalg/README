This directory has BLAS and LAPACK files needed
by the USER-ATC package (or other packages in the future).

You should only need to build and use the files in this
directory if you want to build LAMMPS with the USER-ATC package
and do not have the standard BLAS and LAPACK libraries on your
system.

Use one of the Makefiles provided to build this library.
You may need to edit if for your system.

When you are done building this library, one file should
exist in this directory:

liblinalg.a		the library LAMMPS will link against

You can then include this library and its path in any packages that
need it, e.g. in the lib/atc/Makefile.lammps file.
