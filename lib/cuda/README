This directory has source files to build a library that LAMMPS
links against when using the USER-CUDA package.

When you are done building this library, two files should
exist in this directory:

liblammpscuda.a		the library LAMMPS will link against
Makefile.lammps		settings the LAMMPS Makefile will import

The latter file will have settings like this (can be omitted if blank):

user-cuda_SYSINC = -I$(CUDA_INSTALL_PATH)/include 
user-cuda_SYSLIB = -lcuda -lcudart -lrt 
user-cuda_SYSPATH = -L$(CUDA_INSTALL_PATH)/lib64 -L$(CUDA_INSTALL_PATH)/lib $(CUDA_USRLIB_CONDITIONAL)

SYSINC is for settings needed to compile LAMMPS source files
SYSLIB is for additional system libraries needed by this package
SYSPATH is the path(s) to where those libraries are

You must insure these settings are correct for your system, else
the LAMMPS build will likely fail.

Christian - there needs to additional info here about how
to build the lammpscuda lib.
