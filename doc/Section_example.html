<H3>7. Example problems 
</H3>
<P>The LAMMPS distribution includes an examples sub-directory with
several sample problems.  Each problem is in a sub-directory of its
own.  Most are 2d models so that they run quickly, requiring at most a
couple of minutes to run on a desktop machine.  Each problem has an
input script (in.*) and produces a log file (log.*) and dump file
(dump.*) when it runs.  Some use a data file (data.*) of initial
coordinates as additional input.  A few sample log file outputs on
different machines and different numbers of processors are included in
the directories to compare your answers to.  E.g. a log file like
log.crack.foo.P means it ran on P processors of machine "foo".
</P>
<P>The dump files produced by the example runs can be animated using the
xmovie tool described in the <A HREF = "Section_tools.html">Additional Tools</A>
section of the LAMMPS documentation.  Animations of many of these
examples can be viewed on the Movies section of the <A HREF = "http://lammps.sandia.gov">LAMMPS WWW
Site</A>.

<P>Here is how you might run and visualize one of the sample problems:
</P>
<PRE>cd indent
cp ../../src/lmp_linux .           # copy LAMMPS executable to this dir
lmp_linux < in.indent              # run the problem 
</PRE>
<P>Running the simulation produces the files <I>dump.indent</I> and
<I>log.lammps</I>.  You can visualize the dump file as follows:
</P>
<PRE>../../tools/xmovie/xmovie -scale dump.indent 
</PRE>
<HR>

<P>There is also an ELASTIC directory with an example script for
computing elastic constants, using a zero temperature Si example.  See
the in.elastic file for more info.
</P>
<P>There is also a USER directory which contains subdirectories of
user-provided examples for user packages.  See the README files in
those directories for more info.  See the doc/Section_start.html file
for more info about user packages.
