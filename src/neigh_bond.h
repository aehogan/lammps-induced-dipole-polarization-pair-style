/* ERROR/WARNING messages:

E: Bond atoms %d %d missing on proc %d at step %ld

The 2nd atom needed to compute a particular bond is missing on this
processor.  Typically this is because the pairwise cutoff is set too
short or the bond has blown apart and an atom is too far away.

E: Angle atoms %d %d %d missing on proc %d at step %ld

One or more of 3 atoms needed to compute a particular angle are
missing on this processor.  Typically this is because the pairwise
cutoff is set too short or the angle has blown apart and an atom is
too far away.

E: Dihedral atoms %d %d %d %d missing on proc %d at step %ld

One or more of 4 atoms needed to compute a particular dihedral are
missing on this processor.  Typically this is because the pairwise
cutoff is set too short or the dihedral has blown apart and an atom is
too far away.

E: Improper atoms %d %d %d %d missing on proc %d at step %ld

One or more of 4 atoms needed to compute a particular improper are
missing on this processor.  Typically this is because the pairwise
cutoff is set too short or the improper has blown apart and an atom is
too far away.
