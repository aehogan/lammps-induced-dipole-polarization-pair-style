This package implements 3 commands which can be used in a LAMMPS input
script: pair_style lj/coul, pair_style buck/coul, and kspace_style
ewald/n.

The "kspace_style ewald/n" command is similar to standard Ewald for
charges, but also enables the Lennard-Jones interaction, or any 1/r^N
interaction to be of infinite extent, instead of being cutoff.  LAMMPS
pair potentials for long-range Coulombic interactions, such as
lj/cut/coul/long can be used with ewald/n.  The two new pair_style
commands provide the modifications for the short-range LJ and
Buckingham interactions that can also be used with ewald/n.

Two other advantages of kspace_style ewald/n are that 

a) it can be used with non-orthogonal (triclinic symmetry) simulation
boxes

b) it can include long-range summations not just for Coulombic
interactions (1/r), but also for dispersion interactions (1/r^6) and
dipole interactions (1/r^3).

Neither of these options is currently possible for other kspace styles
such as PPPM and ewald.

See the doc pages for these commands for details.
