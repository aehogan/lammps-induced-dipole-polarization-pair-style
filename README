This is the home of a pair style for LAMMPS that includes induced dipole polarization. The attribute "static\_polarizability" is added with units of distance^3. The single pair\_style lj/cut/coul/long/polarization command described below is also added. For more information and implementation details about induced dipole interactions see section 8 of the included pdf file "Theory and simulation of metal-organic materials and biomolecules" in the polarization folder.

> _IMPORTANT: This pair style does not work with multiple processors._ Undefined behavior will happen if you attempt to use this pair style with more than one process.

pair\_style lj/cut/coul/long/polarization command

**Syntax:**

pair\_style lj/cut/coul/long/polarization cutoff1 (cutoff2) keyword value ...

> cutoff = global cutoff for LJ (and Coulombic if only 1 arg) (distance units)

> cutoff2 = global cutoff for Coulombic (optional) (distance units)

> zero or more keyword/value pairs may be appended

> keyword = precision or zodid or fixed\_iteration or damp or max\_iterations or damp\_type or polar\_gs or polar\_gs\_ranked or polar\_gamma

> _precision_ values = precision
> > precision = if fixed\_iteration is disabled, keep iterating until the square of the change in all dipoles is less than precision

> _zodid_ values = yes or no
> > yes/no = whether to only use the first approximation for the induced dipoles

> _fixed\_iteration_ values = yes or no
> > yes/no = whether to use fixed iteration or precision

> _damp_ values = damp
> > damp = the damping parameter if using exponential dipole-dipole interaction damping

> _max\_iterations_ values = iterations
> > iterations = if using precision, the maximum number of iterations to be calculated before returning the first approximation, or, if using using fixed\_iteration, the number of iterations to be calculated

> _damp\_type_ values = exponential or none
> > exponential = use exponential dipole-dipole interaction damping
> > none = don't use any dipole-dipole interaction damping

> _polar\_gs_ values = yes or no
> > yes/no = whether to use the Gauss-Seidel method to speed up convergence

> _polar\_gs\_ranked_ values = yes or no
> > yes/no = whether to use the Gauss-Seidel method with a ranked array to speed up convergence

> _polar\_gamma_ values = gamma
> > gamma = number to precondition the dipoles with to speed up convergence

**Examples:**

pair\_style lj/cut/coul/long/polarization 2.5 12 max\_iterations 30 damp\_type exponential polar\_gs\_ranked yes

**Description:**


> _IMPORTANT: This pair style does not work with multiple processors._ Undefined behavior will happen if you attempt to use this pair style with more than one process.

> The pair style included in this repository adds explicit polarization using induced dipole interactions to the lj/cut/coul/long pair style.

> The electric field created by static charges on other molecules as well as the induced electric field of every other dipole induces dipoles on every atom proportional to their static polarizabilty. The induced dipoles then interact with both the static charges and the other induced dipoles. Polarizabilities are set using the set command and have units of distance^3, for example,

set type 1 static\_polarizability 2.19630

> The static electric field is calculated using a shifted-force coulombic equation (similar to wolf with no damping).

> For more information and implementation details about induced dipole interactions see section 8 of the included pdf file "Theory and simulation of metal-organic materials and biomolecules" in the polarization folder.

**Defaults:**

> iterations\_max = 50

> damping\_type = none

> polar\_damp = 2.1304

> zodid = no

> polar\_precision = 0.00000000001

> fixed\_iteration = no

> polar\_gs = no

> polar\_gs\_ranked = yes

> polar\_gamma = 1.03
